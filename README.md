# ps5_kvc2

In this assignment, an existing 1DOF robot description was modified to become a 2DOF robot by adding 1 link and 1 joint. The minimal_joint_controller node was modified as well, in order to control the new joint, and a modified version of the minimal_robot.launch file is used to automatically open rviz and Gazebo, load the robot model, and activate the joint controller node to control the robot. 

## Example usage
1) First terminal: roscd, catkin_make, roscore.
2) Second terminal: roslaunch ps3_kvc2 ps3_kvc2.launch
3) In the rviz GUI, set the "Fixed Frame" option on the left sidebar to "world." Then click "Add" and add in the RobotModel. 

## Running tests/demos
1) In a new terminal, open rqt_plot; view jnt_vel, jnt_pos and jnt_trq.
2) In Gazebo, experiment by adding in objects for the robot to interact with.
